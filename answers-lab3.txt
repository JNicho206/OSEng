Exercise 4
1. There are many features that would break if all interupts were invoked the same way. 
- We would be unable to maintain information about how the interrupt was invoked.
- We couldn't invoke a specific interrupt to handle when a user does something it doesn't have privelege.

2. The softint program would not behave correctly if we have kernel protections in place that invoke interrupt 13 when the user does something
doesn't have privelege for. It should produce interrupt 13 since the user shouldn't be able to manually call interrupt 14. If they could, kernel
security would be weakened.
